            <p class="lyrics"> I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies
                    And hypotheses can't define how I be droppin' these
                    Mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery
                    Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
                    Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits
                    Tremendous, ultra-violet shine blind forensics
                    I inspect view through the future see millennium
                    Killa Beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
                    Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
                    Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
                    Black Wu jackets Queen Beez ease the guns in
                    Rumblin' patrolmen tear gas laced the function
                    Heads by the score take flight incite a war
                    Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
                    Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
                    Proceeds to blow swingin' swords like Shinobi
                    Stomp grounds I pound footprints in solid rock
                    Wu got it locked, performin' live on your hottest block
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As the world turns, I spread like germs
                    Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
                    It's my testament to those burned
                    Play my position in the game of life, standing firm
                    On foreign land, jump the gun out the frying pan, into the fire
                    Transform into the Ghostrider, or Six Pack
                    In A Streetcar Named Desire, who got my back?
                    In the line of fire holding back, what?
                    My peoples if you with me where the fuck you at?
                    Niggas is strapped, and they trying to twist my beer cap
                    It's court adjourned, for the bad seed from bad sperm
                    Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm, what the blood
                    Clot, we smoke pot, and blow spots
                    You want to think twice, I think not
                    The Iron Lung ain't got ta tell you where it's coming from
                    Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
                    Rip through your slums
                   <br>
                   <br>
                    I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
                    Loot my voice on the LP, my team is on to slang rocks
                    Certified chatterbox, vocabulary 'Donna talking
                    Tell your story walking
                    Take cover kid, what? Run for your brother, kid
                    Run for your team, and your six camp rhyme groupies
                    So I can squeeze with the advantage, and get wasted
                    My deadly notes reigns supreme
                    Your fort is basic compared to mine
                    Domino effect, arts and crafts
                    Paragraphs contain cyanide
                    Take a free ride on my thought, I got the fashion
                    Catalogs for all y'all to all praise to the Gods
                    The saga continues
                    Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
                    The thrill of victory, the agony, defeat
                    We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow
                    For, judgment day come'th, conquer, it's war
                    Allow us to escape, hell glow spinning bomb
                    Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
                    Tune spit the shit immortal combat sound
                    The fake false step make, the blood stain the ground
                    A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
                    A death kiss, cap off squeeze another anthem
                    Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthetics
                    My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
                    My music Sicily, rich California smell
                    An axe killer adventure, paint a picture well
                    I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sippin' on ginseng
                    Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring king
                    Watch for the wooden soldiers, see-cypher punks couldn't hold us
                    A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
                    Perpendicular to the square, we stand bold like Flare
                    Escape from your Dragon's Lair, in particular
                    My beats travel like a vortex, through your spine
                    To the top of your cerebral cortex
                    Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
                    Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
                    Or terminal, like Grand Central Station
                    Program fat baselines, on Novation
                    Getting drunk like a fuck I'm duckin' five-year probation
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    War of the masses, the outcome, disastrous
                    Many of the victim family save they ashes
                    A million names on walls engraved in plaques
                    Those who went back, received penalties for their acts
                    Another heart is torn, as close ones gone
                    Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song
                    The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
                    And leaks sounds that's heard
                    Ninety-three million miles away from came one
                    To represent the Nation, this is a gathering
                    Of the masses that come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
                    As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
                    The High Chief Jamel-Ah-Rief take the stage
                    Light is provided through sparks of energy
                    From the mind that travels in rhyme form
                    Giving sight to the blind
                    The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
                    Death only one can save shell from
                    This relentless attack of the track spares none
                    Yo! Yo! Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
                    Lampin' like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
                    Codeine was forced in your drink
                    You had a Navy Green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream
                    You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
                    Blowing like Shalamar in eighty-one
                    Sound convincing, thousand dollar court by convention
                    Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission hold the
                    Fuck up, Allah fasten your wig, bad luck
                    I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
                    It's me, Black Noble Drew Ali
                    Came in threes we like the Genovese
                    Is that so? Caesar needs the greens
                    It's Earth, ninety-three million miles from the first
                    Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Hey yo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul off
                    Connect thoughts to make my man Shai walk
                    Swift notarizer, Wu-Tang, all up in the high-riser
                    New York gank adviser world tranquilizer
                    Just the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
                    While, my pen blow lines ferocious
                    Mediterranean, see ya, the number one traffic
                    Sit down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
                    The swift chancellor, flex, the white-gold tarantula
                    Track truck diesel, play the weed God, substantiala
                    Max mostly, undivided, then slide it, it's sickening
